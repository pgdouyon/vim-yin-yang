Yin-Yang
========

Yin-Yang is a black and white color scheme for Vim and is heavily inspired by
[preto][] and [base16-grayscale][].

I liked preto's subtle use of colors in a black/white color scheme but found the
contrast too high for my liking, so I created Yin-Yang as a low contrast
version of preto.
